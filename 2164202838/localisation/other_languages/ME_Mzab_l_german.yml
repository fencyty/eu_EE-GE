 MZB_form_rustamids_title: "@RST Form Rustamids"
 MZB_form_rustamids_desc: "As far back as the early 700s, the Ibadi movement had planted its roots within the communities of northern Africa. Despite persecution, ridicule, and endless violence the faithful eventually found peace within the deserts of Algeria. It is here where they began their great kingdom, the Rustamid Dynasty. A cosmopolitan paradise of learning and trade, the glorious kingdom drew in visitors from across the Christian and Muslim worlds. The once golden city of Tiaret, the Lioness, was the center of it all, a true testament to the heights of this magnificent realm. As the sands of time blew across the desert, they began to shroud this fabulous legacy. However, our success as of late has revived the memories of this once great realm! Having dusted off the tomes of old, many in our realm proclaim our Imam the true successor to the Rustamid legacy. Let us embrace this destiny and push the Ibadi faith, and the Rustamid Kingdom, to new heights. Inshallah!"

 RST_small_community_desc: "Dotted across the vast deserts of Algeria, our nation consists of numerous, highly independent, communities. Many would view this as a weakness but, as Ibadis, we know see the value in small communities of the faithful.

 RST_convert_the_heretics_desc: "All people who profess their belief in the oneness of God may be tolerated to some degree. Those who further believe in the prophetic nature of Muhammad are members of the ummah, or the wider Islamic community who should garner our respect. However, it is our duty as the only true Muslims to guide the ahl al-khilaf, the unbelievers, toward the true path. Our communities should be encouraged to follow notions of walaya, affiliation, with Ibadis and bara’a, disassociation, with unbelievers. In this way we can ensure that the heretical masses are slowly turned towards the light."

 RST_major_stop_along_trade_routes_desc: "The Sahara desert is as vast as it is desolate. Security is almost as rare as water and food when traveling the deserts vast trade routes. However, as our oasis cities rise above the rolling dunes to meet the eyes of weary travelers they are sure to breathe a sigh of relief. Those souls who dare make the trek to our lands do carry one thing in great store, gold. We must utilize our central position in the desert to lighten the loads of our guests and collect a piece of their fabulous luxaries and vast hordes of treasure."

Ultimately, however, this doesn’t matter so long as they are loyal to our Imam, as such we must ensure their loyalty through all manner of statecraft. We will teach these wild dogs to heel at the command of our mighty Imam, whatever it takes."

 ME_Mzab_Events.2.t: "Election of a New Imam" 
 ME_Mzab_Events.2.d: "The rule over the Ibadi communities was exercised in a way much contrary to other contemporary states. In those communities, there existed notions of a Strong and Weak Imams. A strong Imam is an able ruler, well versed in the Fiqh and extent of Muslim law. Such expertise and renown take a long time to master and acquire. Unlike the strong, a weak Imam is only expected to be chosen in dire times and is expect to consult the Ulema in many cases." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.2.a: "In dire times, we need an Imam who can defend our community." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.2.b: "In times of peace, we need an Imam learned in Fiqh." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.2.c: "Let us maintain the rule of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]." 
 
 ME_Mzab_Events.3.t: "An Ibadi Fatwa" 
 ME_Mzab_Events.3.d: "Backed by the imam, a collection of most respected scholars of the realm have just published a joint religious ruling on the significance of the fight to liberate our brethren. The fatwa has been received with much fervor, many zealous men deciding to support the cause." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.3.a: "No longer will the Ibadi be in taqiyya." 
 
 ME_Mzab_Events.4.t: "The Omani Join Our Cause" 
 ME_Mzab_Events.4.d: "Our announcement has reached the distant Oman, where many other Ibadis live. The Sultan himself has chosen to sponsor the cause, sending many of his warriors to the cause." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.4.a: "Any and all help is welcome." 
 
 ME_Mzab_Events.5.t: "Faithful of the Mountains" 
 ME_Mzab_Events.5.d: "As our armies enter the towns and villages within the mountains, the local Ibadi rejoice, for their prayers have been answered. No more shall they live in seclusion or oppression." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.5.a: "O come out, all ye faithful." 
 
 ME_Mzab_Events.6.t: "Rustamids Return to Tahert" 
 ME_Mzab_Events.6.d: "At last, one of the Rustamid rump states, the M'zab, has finally been able to retake the highlands and to return the lands its rightful Ibadi faith. History Books will speak of this day, as it shall mark a new rise of the Rustamid cause." 
 ME_Mzab_Events.6.a: "God is truly great."
