 ME_Provence_Events.3.t: "Unifying the Capetians"
 ME_Provence_Events.3.d: "The Capetian dynasty is one of the largest and oldest royal houses in all of Europe and the world. Due to dynastic rivalries it got broken down into many cadet braches which spread all over Europe. With the reunification of these cadet branches many have started dreaming of a return to the Capetian Empire."

 ME_Provence_Events.4.t: "The Sicilian Dream"
 ME_Provence_Events.4.d: "At long last, our dream of controlling Sicily and returning it back into our fold is complete.

 ME_Provence_Events.5.t: "Extending Our Reach"

 ME_Provence_Events.6.t: "Restoring the Feast"
 ME_Provence_Events.6.d: "\"I will return to Jerusalem, my holy city, and live there. It will be known as the faithful city, and the hill of the Lord Almighty. Once again old men and women, so old that they use canes when they walk, will be sitting in the city squares. And the streets will again be full of boys and girls playing. I will rescue my people from the lands where they have been taken, and will bring them back from east and west to live in Jerusalem.\" We have fulfilled Gods prophecy and restored Jerusalem back to its rightful owners. It will be a beacon of light to all Christians alike. The third temple will be restored and preparations will be made for the coming of the Messianic age. All of Christendom will once again celebrate the liberation of Jerusalem with The Feast that our forefathers once had in remembrance of the First Liberation during the First Crusade."
 ME_Provence_Events.6.a: "Let us restore Jerusalem to its former glory."
 ME_Provence_Events.6.b: "We have fulfilled our vow to God and the Christian world alike."

Diplomats have arrived into our court asking us to be integrated diplomatically into the Provencal lands for some autonomy."
 ME_Provence_Events.9.a: "Let us merge our states into a greater country."
 ME_Provence_Events.9.b: "We reject the good king's offer. Vive la Lorraine!"
 
 ME_Provence_Events.10.t: "A Letter From the Emperor"
 ME_Provence_Events.10.d: "With our acquisition of the Duchy of Lorraine we have come very close inside the sphere of influence of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor has sent us an invitational letter that will grant us access into the empire. Being a member of the empire will surely be a decisive factor when it comes to protection but it will end up ruining our relations with France."
 ME_Provence_Events.10.a: "We must rely on the empire and forgo of all alliances."
 ME_Provence_Events.10.b: "We can't betray France and forgo of their protection."
 
 ME_Provence_Events.11.t: "La Fete"
