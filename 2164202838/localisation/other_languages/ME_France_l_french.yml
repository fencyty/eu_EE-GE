 fra_victory_alps_title: "Victories on the Alps"
 fra_victory_alps_desc: "The mountainous terrain of Italy has always made it a region that is difficult to invade and the Italians know it.

 fra_on_offensive_title: "On the Offensive"
 fra_on_offensive_desc: "Even though every major engagement we take will be deep inside enemy territory, being on the defensive is not an option.

This program was crucial in establishing a stable, self-sustaining population in the early years of French colonization in North America."

 fra_louisiana_title: "Land of Louis"
 fra_louisiana_desc: "In 1682, the French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, claimed the vast Mississippi River basin for France, naming it Louisiana in honor of King Louis XIV. French settlers soon established key outposts such as New Orleans in 1718, transforming the region into a bustling center for trade and culture. This new territory, with its fertile lands and strategic waterways, became a vital link in France's expansive North American empire, blending French, Native American, and African influences into a unique cultural tapestry."

 fra_brazil_title: "France Anstarctique"
 fra_brazil_desc: "France Antarctique was a short-lived French colony established in 1555 on the southeastern coast of present-day Brazil, near Rio de Janeiro. Led by Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon, the colony aimed to provide a haven for French Protestants fleeing religious persecution and to expand French influence in the New World. Despite initial success and alliances with local indigenous tribes, the colony ultimately fell to Portuguese forces in 1567, ending France's early attempts at establishing a foothold in South America."

This policy involved quartering dragoons, or soldiers, in the homes of Huguenots, where they would often harass and intimidate the occupants into converting. The Dragonnades were part of a broader strategy of religious persecution that culminated in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, leading to the mass exodus of Huguenots from France."

 fra_northern_italy_title: "To Relieve a Domain"
 fra_northern_italy_desc: "Constant strife and warfare have been plaguing the Milanese due to incompetent rulers who are only concerned with drinking wine and wasting their time looking at arts.
