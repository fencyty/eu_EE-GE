 form_paderborn_nation_title: "Form the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn"
 form_paderborn_nation_desc: "The Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1281 to 1802. The Diocese of Paderborn was founded in 799 by Pope Leo III. In the early years it was subordinated to the bishop of Würzburg. Since 855 the clergy had the right to elect the bishop. The diocese included the larger part of Lippe, Waldeck, and nearly half of the County of Ravensberg. \n\nWe, as the owner of §Y[2972.GetName]§!, have to honor this legacy and recreate the @PAD §YPrince-Bishopric of Paderborn§!."
 
 papacy_events.99.t: "An Imperial Ambition"
 papacy_events.99.d: "The Holy Roman Empire, which we are a devout and loyal elector of, is practically ablaze with strive. Foreign enemies encroaching from all sides, a weak and decrepid husk of an emperor, and heresies spreading all throughout it. To say that it is heading towards collapse would be an understatement. As the Kingdom of God, led by the Holy Father of all Christendom, we simply cannot let this happen. If no one else will, then we are the ones who must take the reins of this ship and return it onto a holy path, even if it means having to change some of our old traditions."

 papacy_events.99.b: "Our traditions are too important to abandon."
 
 papacy_events.991.d: "In the year of our lord, [GetYear], the most serene Holy Father [Emperor.Monarch.GetName], Romanorum Imperator, supreme Pontiff, chosen by God, has again convened the Estates of the Holy Roman Empire. The Diet has agreed to a motion to unite the disparate states of The Empire into unified Empire of God on Earth and recrown the [Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle] as its hereditary ruler."
